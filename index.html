        <h1>Mr. Brown</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a quiet little town, there lived a man named Mr. Brown. 
            He was an ordinary man with an extraordinary dream: he wanted to be the best ninja in the world. 
            He practiced every day, hiding in bushes and jumping over fences, but somehow, he never felt quite right. 
            One sunny afternoon, while Mr. Brown was practicing his stealth moves by the pond, 
            he spotted a goldfish swimming gracefully in the water.
            <br>
            <br>
            Curiosity got the better of Mr. Brown. “Alright, fish. What do you know about being a ninja? ”
            The goldfish wiggled with excitement. “First, you must learn to be light on your feet—like water. 
            When you move, you should be silent and smooth. Practice in the mud if you can. 
            It's slippery, just like life sometimes! ”
